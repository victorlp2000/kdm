2016/04/25 look mosquitto configer, try to open webcoket
    Websockets support is currently disabled by default at compile time.
    to enable, need to get source package and compile with
        http://mosquitto.org/download/
        WITH_WEBSOCKETS:=yes in config.mk
    when run make to build, also need to install dependent packages, like:
        sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
        sudo apt-get install libc-ares-dev
        sudo apt-get install libwebsockets-dev
        sudo apt-get install uuid-dev
    then, config websocket as:
        listener 1884 127.0.0.1
        protocol websockets
    websocket test site:
        http://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/js/utility/index.html
